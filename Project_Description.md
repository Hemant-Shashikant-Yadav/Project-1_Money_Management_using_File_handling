# Project-1_Money_Management_using_File_handling

  Here in this project I developed a program which helps us to track our expenses and history of expenses.
  I always forgets where I spend money while watching the payment history and I wanted an app where I could store the history of expenses, but I didn’t find any app. So I thought lets create our own program.
  Here there are 4 main options, ‘Add money to the wallet’, ‘Add expense name’, ‘View remaining balance’, ‘Check last expenses (history)’, ‘Reset expense file’. Each option having different work and defined separately in separate functions.
There are two files created, one for storing the balance and one for the expense list.

Functions:
1.	Add money :
Here simply money is added to your wallet. If the money is already present it is added up in it.
2.	Add expense:
Here first of all it asks for how many number of times you want to add expenses. Then it asks for name of expense and what is cost.
While saving the date and time is added into the data.
The cost is cut from the 	wallet and the remaining balance is shown.
3.	View remaining balance:
Here the balance remaining is displayed
4.	Check last expense:
Here we can see all the expenses we made along with its cost, date and time. 
All the data is shown in table format.
5.	Reset file:
This function deletes all the expenses data and new list is created.
It ask for confirmation for verification.

Problems faced:
1.	While accessing the balance for operations like adding money or subtracting money, the data got from file is in string format. Because we got the data in string format we cannot perform arithmetic operations on it. So first we have to convert that data into integer format. So figuring out this took my most of time during development after that all was easy
2.	While performing work on file handling on 1st time, it was little hard for me to choose right operation. The append and write operation confused me first but now I got the proper knowledge and I can perform any operation easily

  This 1st project boosted my confidence and I’m ready to make more and more new projects.
  My upcoming project will be a bank software. Ill provide a link of it after completing it.
  If any query you can contact me here or on my social media.
